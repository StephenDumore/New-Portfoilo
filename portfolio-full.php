            <h2 class="aleo-title">Carrer Essay</h2>
            <p>This is a paper that I completed for CART. It is a six-page essay on why I believe that I would like to pursue database administration as a career. There was a range of topics that needed to be covered in the paper including wages job outlook how to become one and more. This paper was a great way to learn about a specific career that I was interested in. It was helpful for me formulating my plan and career path.</p>

        <div class="contentwhite-vertical-fullportfolio">
            <p>Investigation and reflection were both habits of mind which I employed heavily while writing this paper. I used investigation by researching database administrators to gain an understanding of how the profession works. I employed reflection by reflecting back on myself and my personal interests and strengths to determine which career would suit me and why. No aspect of the paper stood out as being difficult, but process was challenging overall.  I Surpassed this And completed the paper by persisting even though it was difficult.</p>

            <p>In this project a partner and I collaborated to create a website detailing a proposed humanitarian technology innovation. The hypothetical innovation that we came up with a piezoelectric generator uses the mechanical force of the userâ€™s steps to power a battery. The invention was intended to be something that would be distributed to third world countries where power is not normally present.</p>
