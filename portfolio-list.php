                    <p>For the English Portion of CART Web App I completed a five paragraph literary analysis essay regarding a prompt of my choice on Ernest Cline’s novel <i>Ready Player One</i>. The prompt that I selected was arguing that “The OASIS”, A realistic virtual reality game of vast scale would be beneficial to today’s society. I used a variety of citations from the book and provided thorough elaboration to support my argument.</p>
                    <p>While working on this website two major habits of mind that I employed were investigation and reflection. I Reflected upon the life of the story’s main protagonist, Wade Watts and how The OASIS impacted his life. I utilized investigation to analyze how The OASIS helped people cope with the difficult circumstances of their real lives. I also investigated The OASIS’ power to resolve difficult problems many of which plague our society today.</p>

                    <p>This is a presentation I completed for my Nativo Hablantes (Native Speakers) Spanish class. I was tasked with creating a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation about a specific country with a substantial population of Spanish-Speaking people. The country I chose was the Dominican Republic. While conducting my research I learned a lot about the Dominican Republic and improved my Spanish in the process.</p>
                    <p>Investigation was definitely the habit of mind which I employed the most during this project. Prior to creating the presentation I knew a negligible amount about the Dominican Republic; However, after conducting research on the internet I became knowledgeable of Dominican culture, food, traditions, and much more. My lack of knowledge did present somewhat of a challenge; however, I overcame this by conducting thorough research.</p>

                    <p>This Is a project I completed on inventions from World War Two for my world history class. The object of the project was to create an informative PowerPoint presentation about an important aspect of a specific period in history. Completing the project taught me a lot about conducting research and about history and how inventions from World War Two are still affecting our lives today.</p>
                    <p>The habit of mind which I used the most during this project was investigation. I researched the most important and influential innovations of the time as well as how they worked and their impact. I also researched Albert Einstein since he was a critical intellectual figure at during the era in large part responsible for the invention of the Atomic Bomb. The main challenge that I ran into finding enough information to fulfil the rubric's requirements. I surpassed this obstacle by persisting with my research and carefully selecting which topics to cover.</p>

                <img class="columnimg" src="img/slideshow4.jpg" alt="The website that's based on a reference image">
                <?php include'templates/slide-nav.php'?>
                <div class="slidetxt">
                    <p>This was a Web App assignment were I was tasked with using HTML and CSS to replicate a website with only a picture of the website to use as a reference. The goal of the project was to replicate the website shown in the image as closely and as accurately as possible. For the most part, I was very successful. The majority of my website was indistinguishable from the one shown in the reference image. </p>
                    <p>Coding the html for the website was relatively simple; however, coding the CSS proved to be much more challenging. I had several issues with the spacing and alignment of different items and other aspects of the layout. And it was difficult to make things look exactly as they were in the reference image. I was able to overcome these difficulties by employing habits of mind such as persistence, striving for accuracy, and gathering data. Striving for accuracy allowed me to get the website to look almost identical to the reference image as I paid immense attention to detail. I also was able to learn new css properties that opened doors for me to do things that I had never done before by conducting research and gathering data. The habit of Persistence helped me continue until the project’s completion despite the challenging process.</p>

                <div class="slidetxt">
                    <p>Another web app project that I have completed is my client website. For this project, I found I found a client who needed a website and built a website for them. My client was the Book Club at my home high school, Clovis High School What set this website apart from prior websites that I had completed as projects was that this one had to be developed entirely in PHP. PHP is a server side scripting language that can be utilized to reuse HTML code in order to make the process more efficient. HTML, Javascript and CSS, can all exist within a PHP file so the majority of the coding was done with those languages inside of my PHP Documents.</p>
                    <p>The website overall wasn’t too challenging since the majority of it was made using skills that I had been developing throughout the school year. I did have some challenges working with JavaScript due to having less experience with it and its complexity. However, I surpassed these obstacles by gathering data from all senses. I was able to diagnose many of the problems that were present in my code by observing the behaviour parts of the site that utilized JavaScript. I also was able to learn about the correct approach to the problems I encountered by researching similar applications of JavaScript on the internet.</p>
